# Sales Visualizer

This Python project uses popular modules such as `pandas`, `tkinter`, `matplotlib`, `threading`, and `sqlite3` to create a simple data analyzer and visualizer.
It reads data from a CSV file, stores it in a local SQLite database, and displays various plots through a GUI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib

> Note: `tkinter`, `threading`, and `sqlite3` are part of the Python standard library.
